# MSDT-Exploit 
Exploitation of **MSDT** for Backdoor Access through .doc files using **CVE-2022-30190**

This Program allows you to generate Malicious Word Documents giving you **RCE**

# Usage
- Git Clone or Download this directory into a folder.

- In the folder, open doc-exploit.py and navigate to the 'Data' class and change the variables:

      'host_ip' = The IP you want to host the listener on (I'd recommend your local IP)
      'port' = The port you want the listener to be hosted on (default=8000)
      'command' = The command you would like the maldoc to execute (default opens calculator)
      'output' = the file name you want the maldoc to be built with (default is mal.doc)
      'reverse' = Port to host a reverse shell on (wouldn't recommend if you're a noob)
      'suffix' = The document type (default is "doc" and you shouldn't change it)

- **After you've changed the variables to your liking, go to cmd and run 'python doc-exploit.py'**
- The program will generate a malicious Word Document which will execute your command when opened!

# Note
I'm not encouraging anyone to use this maliciously!
